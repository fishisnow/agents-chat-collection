## Project Introduction

Agents Chat Collection serves solely as a learning resource, collecting various open-source agent and AI interaction processes. By studying these conversations, developers can intuitively understand the operation methods and interaction workflows of different agents, thereby gaining an in-depth understanding of AI conversation systems.

## Collected Agents

### openai-agents

[openai-agents - MCP Filesystem Example](https://fishisnow.github.io/agents-chat-collection/openai_agents/conversation_filesystem_mcp.html) - Demonstrates how the AI agent completes user tasks through a file system-based mcp server.

### browser_use

[browser_use - Add Todo Conversation](https://fishisnow.github.io/agents-chat-collection/browser_use/conversation_add_todo.html) - Demonstrates how the AI agent interacts with the browser interface to add a to-do item.

### OpenManus

[OpenManus - Add Todo Conversation](https://fishisnow.github.io/agents-chat-collection/OpenManus/conversation_add_todo.html) - Shows how the AI agent automatically completes the process of adding a to-do item, showcasing intelligent task handling.

### MidScene

[MidScene - Intelligent Task Planning (DOM Tree)](https://fishisnow.github.io/agents-chat-collection/midscene/conversation_plan_by_domtree.html) - Intelligent task analysis and execution planning based on screenshots and the page DOM tree.

[MidScene - Intelligent Task Planning (Visual)](https://fishisnow.github.io/agents-chat-collection/midscene/conversation_plan_by_vision.html) - Intelligent task analysis and execution planning based on visual positioning of interface elements.

[MidScene - DOM Intelligent Recognition](https://fishisnow.github.io/agents-chat-collection/midscene/conversation_inspect_by_domtree.html) - Accurately identifies the IDs of page elements based on screenshots and the page DOM tree.

[MidScene - Visual Intelligent Positioning](https://fishisnow.github.io/agents-chat-collection/midscene/conversation_inspect_by_vision.html) - Uses visual positioning of interface elements to return the coordinates of elements (requires a large model supporting visual positioning).

### openui

[openui - Create Personal Homepage Example](https://fishisnow.github.io/agents-chat-collection/openui/conversation_create_homepage.html) - Demonstrates how the AI agent creates a personal homepage website.
